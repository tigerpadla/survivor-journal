# Survivor Journal

## Overview
The Bootcamp Survivor Journal is a Django based project designed to give students of the 16 week Code Institute Bootcamp a place to document their personal experiences of undertaking and completing the 16 week Full Stack Development course.
This is not just a log of tasks, it is a place for students to record their transformation and resilience throughout the course. A place for them to voice their trials and tribulations.
